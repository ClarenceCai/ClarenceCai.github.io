You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

### Home Page
Home page is in `index.md` . Don't need to change. Layout helps put blogs on the home page.

### Layout
Layouts are in `_layouts` folder and there are 4 types to choose from.

|layout|description|

|default|base of other 3|
|home|the home page layout|
|post|the post layout|
|page|a pure page|

### Posts

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
