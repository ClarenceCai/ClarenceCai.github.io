title: After installing Ubuntu
---

After changing the HDD to SSD in my laptop, I decided to use **Linux** instead of **Windows** as my operating system. I made a bootable Ubuntu USB stick by following this [tutorial](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#0).

## Python
In ubuntu 16.04 LTS, python 2.7 and python 3.5 are preinstalled, I only need to install pip3 and upgrade it:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
Then, I installed 

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* tensorflow
* jupyter notebook

I installed a powerful python IDE **Pycharm** and used the preinstalled interpreter `python3.5` which was located in `/usr/bin`
