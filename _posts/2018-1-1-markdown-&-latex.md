title: Markdown & Latex
---

Seeing Michael Nielsen's chapters with math formulas embeded in, I wanted to put latex math in my posts. Because I used Jekyll as my webpage engine, I followed this post [MathJax with Jekyll](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/) to set up my environment.

There is one thing worth paying attention, Github no longer supports ~~`redcarpet`~~ as its markdown praser so we need to set `kramdown` as the new markdown processor.
